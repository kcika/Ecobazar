                    As the new year approaches, one of your resolutions may be to make healthier food choices. It
                    may seem overwhelming at
                    first, but it doesn’t have to be. We have put together some helpful ways to incorporate organic
                    products into your
                    healthy diet. It's not only thinking about it, but this includes planning and understanding food
                    labels.

                    First let’s define what eating organic is. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture the
                    term “Organic” is food
                    that is free from processed and synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and weedicides in both
                    produce, grains, and animal
                    products including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-disc ms-6 my-1">Whole grains (brown rice, millet, oatmeal, etc.)</li>
                    <li class="list-disc ms-6 my-1">High-quality proteins (grass-fed beef, organic chicken, etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-disc ms-6 my-1">Plant-based proteins (beans, nuts, seeds, etc.)</li>
                    <li class="list-disc ms-6 my-1">Fruits and Vegetables; and</li>
                    <li class="list-disc ms-6 my-1">Healthy fats (avocados, coconut oil, etc.)</li>

                <p class="text-lg mb-4">When planning to adopt an organic diet, it helps to plan your meals in
                    advance. Whether you use an online tracker, a
                    spreadsheet, or a list, keeping track of your meals is vital when it comes to eating healthy and
                    organically.
                    <br>
                    Begin by drafting potential meals for the week. Find healthy recipe inspiration here. Once
                    you’ve solidified your meal
                    plan, list the recipes and ingredients for each one. You can list them by category, for example
                    vegetables, fruits,
                    protein, oils etc. Whether you plan to make golden turmeric overnight oats for breakfast or
                    fresh vegetables, quinoa and
                    tofu for dinner, planning your meals will help you stay organized. An added bonus is that
                    planning a shopping list often
                    helps with staying within your grocery budget as well.
                    <br>
                    Pick a day that works for you to go grocery shopping and prepare your meals. It may seem like a
                    lot of work upfront, but
                    you'll see how smoothly your week goes and can ensure your diet is filled with organic foods
                    that you need to stay
                    healthy.

                    Understand the nutrition labels

                <p class="text-lg mb-2">
                    Understanding nutrition labels is good practice when you’re making healthier choices. You don’t
                    have to be an expert at
                    reading labels, however, having a basic understanding of what you are putting in your body will
                    be a helpful part of
                    your journey.
                    <br>
                    Here is a tip, instead of selecting generic versions of foods, look for foods with labels that
                    read “Organic” or “USDA
                    Certified ''. Generally, it will be labeled on the front of the packaging, in letters or in
                    large print. You should be
                    able to find the organic call out on both the front panel, as well as on the information panel
                    of the product. For
                    example, Nature’s Path Organic Heritage Flakes Cereal uses organic callouts in a number of ways.

                    page to get familiar with where they may be found.

                    For additional helpful information on organic labeling in the U.S., visit USDA. GOV- Organic
                    Products. However, don’t
                    stress too much about the percentages, being mindful of what the claims mean is a great start.
                    Keep in mind, anything
                    that has an organic label is better than the conventional processed foods.

                </p>
                <p class="text-lg mb-3">
                    Keeping a healthy organic diet is all about focusing on the food itself. Eating a wide variety
                    of vegetables, fruits,
                    grains, protein, and dairy products is important. It can help you meet your daily nutritional
                    requirements while also
                    providing you with the essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber your body needs.
                    <br>
                    Fruits and vegetables are important because they are high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals and
                    low in fat. In addition,
                    it's also an important source of antioxidants that help your body fight off free radicals. Keep
                    in mind that some fruits
                    and vegetables contain high levels of pesticides so either buy organic or grow your own produce
                    if you can.
                    <br>
                    Whole Grains are rich in fiber and other nutrients that are often removed during processing.
                    Whole grains also contain
                    antioxidant compounds called phytochemicals which help lower your risk for chronic diseases like
                    cancer and heart
                    disease. To learn more about these compounds, read this article by Zhang YJ et al. (2015). The
                    easiest way to make sure
                    you're eating whole grains is to look for products labeled ”100% whole grain.
                    <br>
                    Protein and dairy products are also essential for your body. However, there is a greater
                    nutritional benefit when it's
                    organic because it contains omega-3 fatty acids and more antioxidants, and no hormones or
                    pesticides.

                <p class="text-lg mb-3">Home cooking is a great way to prioritize a healthy organic diet because you

                    go into your body. Although going out to a restaurant is convenient, you cannot be certain what
                    ingredients are in their
                    foods; some restaurant foods can be highly processed and unhealthy.
                    <br>
                    Instead, purchase good quality organic products from your local grocery store and prepare a meal
                    for yourself and your
                    family. This way you will save money and your body will feel better.
                    <br>
                    If you are in a rush in the morning make a quick yogurt parfait with Hemp Hearts granola or a
                    tasty gluten-free cereal
                    with a splash of your favorite organic nut milk.

                    Commit to an Eating Schedule
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg mb-3">Committing to an eating schedule everyday can help you feel more in control
                    of your eating habits. When you decide to
                    eat at certain times, you create a routine that will help you stay on track with consuming more
                    healthy organic foods.
                    The time you eat does not matter. Most people have their lunch, midday or around 12 p.m. and
                    avoid eating 2-3 hours
                    before bedtime.
                    <br>
                    According to a few studies published on ScienceDaily.com, eating irregularly puts you at risk
                    for high blood pressure,
                    type 2 diabetes, and obesity. As you prepare your meals, make a mental note of when you plan to
                    eat breakfast, lunch,
                    and dinner. The best part, if you make food you’re excited to eat, you’ll find yourself looking
                    forward to each meal and
                    sticking to the best times to enjoy them.
                    <br>
                    Planning and learning to take control of your health is the key to maintaining a healthy organic
                    diet. Remember that
                    it's not about being perfect but being aware and purposeful. That is what will help you succeed
                    in your health journey.
                    <br>
                    Find organic products you look forward to enjoying and remember that small changes can make a
                    big impact. Nature’s Path
